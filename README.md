**Resilience4j** is a library designed to improve the resilience of applications, especially in microservices architectures. Itâ€™s particularly useful for handling failures in systems that rely on external services. Resilience4j offers a range of tools to help maintain the health of all system components.

Main features include:

1.  **Circuit Breaker**: Stops external service calls when the error rate exceeds a certain threshold, preventing error propagation.
    
2.  **Retry**: Allows retrying a failed operation a specified number of times.
    
3.  **Rate Limiter**: Limits the number of calls within a certain timeframe.
    
4.  **Bulkhead**: Restricts the number of concurrent calls, helping manage resource consumption.
    
5.  **Time Limiter**: Sets a maximum duration for an operation, terminating it if it exceeds that time.
